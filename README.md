# Watering_Device_Mobile_Application
This is the code for the mobile application of the automated IOT Watering Device(https://github.com/joel909/Smart_Watering_Device_iot_esp) to control monitor and Supervise 

## Getting Started
This is a little more complicated to setup in comparison with the ESP code form the watering device application but if you have good app developemnt knowledge this should not be a challenge you need to go to the firebase_options.dart and put the values from the key which you can downlaod from firebase. In the android studio application if you open it in it you can go to TOOLS>Firease to get this file automatically set up for you .

for the mqtt client you do not need any extra credentials but rather you can fill in the same credentials in the respective places.
